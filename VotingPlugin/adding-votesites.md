# Ways of adding votesites

## Auto generation (Easiest)
This is the easiest way to add votesites. Simply vote and a votesite will generate in VoteSites.yml with the correct Service Site.
This requires that votifier is working and setup properly. This is enabled by default in Config.yml.

## VotingPluginEditor
External editor with sftp support
Available [here](https://github.com/BenCodez/VotingPluginEditor)

## Manually configure
Create a votesite manually in VoteSites.yml. Just make sure to set the correct Service Site.

## Ingame
Create ingame, /av gui (Middle click votesites)
